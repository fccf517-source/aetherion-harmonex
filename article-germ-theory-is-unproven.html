			No one would( or atleast should) hire a cook who couldn’t describe the 
			exact steps he or she would use to bake a cake. Similarly, no one would 
			hire a carpenter to build a wood shed who had never heard of a hammer. 
			And any person who doesn’t know the exact steps a virologist takes to 
			answer the question posed in the title of this chapter can’t possibly judge 
			whether SARS-CoV-2, the virus that allegedly causes COVID-19, exists. To 
			be clear, I don’t mean an answer such as, “you do a test for the virus,” or, 
			“all doctors believe there is such a virus.” I am specifically referring to the 
			steps any virologist in the world should take to identify a new virus. I am 
			convinced that once you understand exactly these steps, you will never 
			again believe that any virus has ever caused any disease. As hard as it 
			might be to accept, the truth is that simple.
        </p>
        <p>
			In a sane and rational world, medical authorities would have made the 
			answer to this straightforward question the first and highest priority in 
			their role as educators of the population. As you will see, the process is 
			simple to understand. Thus, there is no reason every person in the world 
			should not know how to answer this basic question.
        </p>
        <p>
			First, let’s start with how the overwhelming majority of laymen and health 
			professionals alike believe that a virologist goes about proving the 
			existence of a virus. When I have asked people this question, the answer I 
			most often hear is,  
			“Millions of people all over the world are getting sick and dying; therefore, 
			it must be a virus.”
        </p>

        <hr class="article-divider" />
       

        <p>
			Oftentimes, people claim that it has been shown that the disease has 
			spread from place to place, or from person to person, which must “prove” 
			that the cause is a virus. Sometimes, they point to stories they have read, 
			such as,  
			“This prison had no cases of COVID, and then someone with COVID was 
			sent there, at which time many people got sick” (or at least tested 
			“positive”), which again proves it must be a virus. 
        </p>
		<p>
			Doesn't it??
		</p>
		<p>
			Sometimes, it is the story of some Auntie, who went to church, only to fall 
			ill a week later after having been exposed to someone at church who 
			tested positive.  
		</p>
		<p>
			I have heard scores of such stories. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The important point to make is that no "legit" scientist, virologist or 
			competent medical professional would claim that these epidemiological 
			observations prove the existence of any virus. In fact, the role of 
			epidemiology in medicine and science is primarily to generate hypotheses, 
			which then can be tested in the laboratory to prove causation.
		</p>
		
		
        <hr class="article-divider" />
		
		<p>
			Epidemiology can never prove the existence of any virus, nor prove the 
			cause of any disease. That is simply not its role. On this, I think that there 
			is virtually no disagreement in the scientific world.  Furthermore, if the 
			fact that a lot of people getting sick in the same place proves viral 
			causation, then we could logically conclude that bomb blasts must have 
			been a virus. If we claim that a disease that spreads is also proof of viral 
			causation, then the Chernobyl disaster could have been caused by a virus. 
			For more than a hundred years, people observed that one sailor after 
			another got sick on ships. Their teeth fell out, and many went into heart 
			failure and died. For many, it was “obvious” that something was being 
			passed-a contagion-from one sailor to the next. 
		</p>
		<p>
			At some point, however, a sailor ate a lime; the whole thing went away 
			because, in fact, the sick sailors were suffering from scurvy, a disease 
			caused by vitamin C deficiency. 
			There are many other examples illustrating how epidemiological 
			observations have misled a medical profession stubbornly bound to the 
			idea of contagion.
		</p>
		<p>
			Beriberi and pellagra, two well-known nutritional deficiencies, were 
			considered for decades to be caused by a contagion. It turns out the cause 
			was B vitamin deficiency, which, as one would expect, would often show 
			up in the same family members at the same time.  
		</p>
		<p>
			To reiterate the point, the role of epidemiology in science is-or should be
			to suggest avenues to explore. And when scientists misuse epidemiology, 
			they are doing “more harm than good” 
		</p>
		
		
        <hr class="article-divider" />
		
		<p>
			Let’s take the next step. Here, we are describing what most people think 
			has happened and what the vast majority of medical doctors believe has 
			happened.  
			Most people assume that the first thing researchers do when confronted 
			with a new illness is carefully define the symptoms. Then, once they have 
			found a significant number of similarly sick people, the assumption is that 
			the researchers examine various bodily f luids from the sick people to find 
			a common virus. The general expectation is that the virus will then prove 
			to be abundant in these people, that it will demonstrate a uniform 
			morphology (size, shape and other defining physical features) and that 
			each virus (called a virion) will be shown to contain the identical genetic 
			material. This is the clear, logical and rational approach to the discovery 
			of a new virus.
		</p>	
		<p>
			The actual facts contradict this rational approach. Although some “viral” 
			diseases do share a common symptom picture, many, such as “COVID-19,” 
			do not. This phenomenon obviously complicates matters, for without a 
			clear definition of the illness as a starting point, identifying which sick 
			people to examine immediately becomes a challenging hurdle. But even in 
			the most clearly defined “viral” diseases, such as measles or chicken pox, 
			the following shocking statement is still undeniably true:  
		</p>
		<p>
			In the history of medicine, not one published study shows the isolation of 
			identical particles that would represent a disease-causing virus from any 
			bodily fluid from any sick person. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I know it's hard to believe but that is how it is actually!! 
		</p>
		<p>
			Let me make this even more clear. If one takes any person with any “viral” 
			illness-for example, chicken pox, rabies, measles, AIDS or COVID-19-the 
			published literature does not contain any evidence of any virus that was 
			directly isolated from any bodily fluids from even one person suffering 
			from these illnesses. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The interesting thing about this statement is that no health institution 
			from any government in the world disagrees. Similarly, there is no 
			disagreement on this point from any virologist or medical doctor who 
			works in or publishes in the field of virology. And there is no 
			disagreement about this statement from such institutions as the Centers 
			for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Pasteur Institute or the 
			Robert Koch Institute. 
		</p>
		<p>
			To prove this point, we were in possession of nearly 60 written statements 
			from governmental institutions from all over the world confirming that 
			they have no examples of SARS-CoV-2 being isolated directly from any 
			human being.
		</p>
		
		
        <hr class="article-divider" />
		
		<p>
			I also had written statements from some of the lead authors of the most 
			important papers on the “isolation and purification” of SARS-CoV-2, who 
			agree that they never attempted to obtain the virus directly from any fluid 
			of any sick person.  
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, in-person communication with a number of virologists confirms 
			that no pathogenic virus can be isolated from any bodily fluid of any sick 
			person. They simply say that is not the way the science is done ( even 
			though I believe that the science itself is built on a house of cards).  
		</p>
		<p>
			Let’s be very clear, though, on the next point. It isn’t that it is technically 
			impossible, or even difficult, to isolate any particle the size and shape or 
			characteristic of a virus from a fluid sample.
		</p>
		<p>
			For decades, for example, scientists have isolated identical particles 
			(called bacteriophages) from bacterial cultures and showed pure samples 
			of these particles under the electron microscope. In this case, all particles 
			from one culture are morphologically identical, all are made of exactly the 
			same proteins, and all have identical genetic sequences.  
		</p>
		<p>
			The steps to isolate a particle the size and characteristic of a virus are also 
			straightforward and not unlike how a chemist would isolate caffeine from 
			a coffee bean. 
		</p>
		<p>
			First, you take a sample of whatever fluid you wish to examine. Then, you 
			macerate it (as in a blender) and filter the sample through a filter paper 
			that allows anything soluble, including any particle the size of a virus, to 
			pass through the paper. After discarding the cells, fungi and bacteria, you 
			put the remaining fluid on something called a “sucrose density gradient,” 
			which separates it into bands by molecular weight.
		</p>
		<p>
			This entire process is called ultracentrifugation.
		</p>
		
		
        <hr class="article-divider" />
		
		<p>
			With ultracentrifugation, the virus in question spins out into a band. The 
			band can then be extracted from the gradient with a micro-pipette and 
			checked for purity. In this way, you can confirm that the only thing in the 
			band is the virus. You can then study the virus, determine its exact 
			morphology and sequence its entire genome. Most importantly, you can 
			then expose test animals to this isolated, purified virus to see whether 
			they get sick. These steps are the way science is supposed to work. One 
			isolates the variable-in this case, the virus-and then characterizes the 
			makeup of the virus. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Once one is certain of the existence of the pure virus, test animals can be 
			exposed to it.  
		</p>
		<p>
			Yet this simple, doable experiment has never been successfully done for 
			even one so-called viral disease, and it has certainly never been attempted 
			for COVID-19 and SARSCoV-2.  
		</p>
		<p>
			I repeat... "this process has not been officially carried out even once".
		</p>
		<p>
			Not even once.
		</p>
		<p>
			So as you can see, we are faced here with a dilemma. It is clear that no 
			virologist has ever isolated any pathogenic virus from any bodily fluid of 
			any sick person.
		</p>
		<p>
			How, then, can virologists claim-in thousands of papers, including scores 
			on SARS-CoV-2 alone-that a virus was “isolated,” characterized and shown 
			to cause illness in animals?  
		</p>
		<p>
			There are hundreds of claims that the genome of SARS-CoV-2 has been 
			sequenced, and that variants of this genome have been discovered. 
			Understanding how virologists have felt justified in making this claim is 
			the key to understanding how virology lost its scientific integrity. If they 
			are not following the straightforward steps  described here for isolating a 
			virus, on what basis do virologists claim the existence of a new virus and 
			the proof that this new virus is a pathogen?
