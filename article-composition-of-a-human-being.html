        <p>
			For a long time, I have asked numerous people the simple question,  
			“What is the human being made of?”  
			The answers I have received are sometimes interesting, sometimes a little 
			strange and sometimes very informative.  
			No one, however, has given the answer I was looking for-not that I claim to 
			have the truth about such a complex and ultimately unfathomable 
			question, but I do have a thought that I believe can help us immensely in 
			our understanding of health, illness, why we get sick and what to do about 
			our illnesses.  
			My belief is that we must have a realistic, accurate, truly scientific picture 
			of what a human being is made of to answer another important question
			one that is likely on everyone’s mind-which is,
        </p>
        <p>
			“If it’s not a virus, then why do people get sick?”  
			Let’s look at one approach to answering the question,  
			“What is a human being made of?”  
        </p>
        <p>
			One way to start is to understand that the human being is made of-or 
			perhaps better said, consists of-a head, chest, arms, legs, eyes, ears and 
			many other visible body parts. I base this conclusion on decades of 
			observation of myself and other human beings and, most important, on the 
			fact that every system of science and medicine that has ever existed has 
			fundamentally agreed with this conclusion.
        </p>
		<p>
			I think we all can agree on that here. 
			Next, I want to go deeper. Lying beneath these easily visible parts are 
			structures that are generally referred to as organs. These include the heart, 
			liver, intestines, nerves and so on. 
		</p>
		<p>
			My proof for the existence of these organs is that, in many cases, I can 
			directly feel them in myself or in other people. One can also see them 
			during surgery on living people, and one can easily see them with imaging 
			techniques such as ultrasound and CT scans done on living people. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Again, most importantly, all medical systems I know of not only agree that 
			humans are made of organs but also sometimes view organs as central to 
			their entire medical approach. 
		</p>
		<p>
			For instance, such is the case with Chinese medicine, an ancient discipline 
			that bases its approach on energy flowing through these very organs. Again, 
			I know of no system of medical thinking that does not believe in the 
			existence of the various organs within the human being.
		</p>
		<p>
			I think we all can agree on that as well. 
			Now, let's go one level deeper and ask,  
			“What is an organ?” 
			For instance, what is the liver made of? 
		</p>
		<p>
			Here, we are usually presented with the “obvious” answer that the liver is 
			made of liver cells, called hepatocytes, that are grouped or organized 
			somehow to form the structure we know as the liver.  
			Right??
		</p>
		<p>
			But now we find our first area of disagreement. 
			First, as far as I know, no one has directly seen liver cells in an intact liver 
			in a "living person". 
		</p>
		<p>
			Also, obviously, liver cells are too small to be visualized on any current 
			imaging technique such as ultrasound, CT scanning or MRI testing. 
			The reason liver cells have never been seen directly in an intact organ in a 
			living person could be purely technical, in that liver cells are too small to 
			see without at least with a simple microscope, which can’t be used in a 
			living person. 
		</p>
		<p>
			So, scientists and medical people find liver cells by extracting them from a 
			liver in a living person. Then, they use stains or prepare the tissue in some 
			way and see the characteristic morphology (form and structure) of the 
			hepatocytes under a light microscope.  
			This process seems clear, except that it is widely acknowledged that even 
			the simple act of removing a piece of tissue from its living matrix inevitably 
			has an effect on the morphology, chemistry and behavior of that tissue. 
		</p>
		<p>
			To be as precise as possible here, therefore, we need to eliminate the 
			possibility that our method of investigating living tissue in some way 
			changes the characteristics of that tissue.  
			That step should be the biggest priority for anyone claiming to draw 
			scientific conclusions from this experiment.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is quite unusual to see that, the scientific theory that human beings (and, 
			in fact, all animals) are made of cells is not part of any traditional medical 
			system.
		</p>
		<p>
			Whether we consider Chinese medicine, Ayurvedic medicine, homeopathy, 
			or other traditional healing modalities, none-at least, none that I know of
			has ever mentioned or spoken of the existence of cells.  
			Even though this fact certainly doesn’t prove that cells are not present in 
			living tissue, it is an intriguing historical factoid. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The theory that we are made of cells is actually an extremely new idea. 
			It was essentially created by some German doctor named Rudolf Virchow 
			in the 1850s and, at the time, was met with much criticism and even some 
			derision.  
			Again, this response doesn’t prove Virchow was wrong, only that the 
			cellular theory was one of a long line of theories that has emanated from 
			the overarching materialistic thinking characteristic of the past few 
			centuries. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In this case, the term “materialistic” refers to the school of thought that 
			humans, like everything else in the universe, are 24 simply different forms 
			of material substance. Materialism is the core of freemasonry which leads 
			to a mechanistic view of the world.
		</p>
		<p>
			For materialistic thinkers, concepts such as “energy” or “vital forces” or even 
			the investigation of life itself are simply off the table.  They do no even 
			believe that any of that exists. 
			A final comment on the cell theory is that biologists claim the human being 
			consists of about 188 different tissue types. These include the liver, heart, 
			ovaries, lens of the eye and so forth. Of these 188, about 44 are widely 
			considered to be “syncytium”; the rest are thought to consist of cells. 
		</p>
		<p>
			A syncytium refers to an acellular organ-one homogenous structure with 
			no internal divisions that we would call cells.  
			A well-known example of an organ that is a syncytium is the lens of the eye. 
			(Clearly, having a homogenous, uniform structure as the eye lens is a good 
			idea if the purpose of the organ is to be transparent to light.)  
			In general, it is not clear to me why a cellular structure would benefit, for 
			example, the liver.  
		</p>
		<p>
			While we can see that the liver displays a cellular structure on a biopsy (a 
			process that requires the living tissue to be killed and stained), this does 
			not tell us how cells provide a functional advantage in the activity of the 
			liver.  
			Wouldn’t it be easier, simpler and provide better communication if the 
			organ were made of a uniform, homogenous “matrix” instead of tiny 
			cubicles? 
		</p>
		<p>
			In any case, let’s say that although the cell theory has some problematic 
			aspects, enough evidence exists to conclude that at least some of our organs 
			do seem to be composed of internal divisions, divisions we commonly call 
			“cells.”  
			I think we all can agree on that. 
		</p>
		<p>
			If we go deeper still and ask what a cell consists of, we run into some 
			problems.  
			I would, at this point, urge anyone who is at all interested in the subject of 
			cell biology to read the entire works of these two biologists whose articles i 
			and my friends have read years ago : 
		</p>
		<h2> Harold Hillman and Gilbert Ling. </h2>
		<p>
			In my view, they are the two best biologists who have ever lived. Both Ling 
			and Hillman pointed out that the biology of the past 100 years is fraught 
			with problems related to how data are obtained. 
			They went against the grain and started questioning the approach itself. 
			Their work is invaluable in grounding us in the reality of what exists in 
			living systems, and differentiating what exists from what is an artifact. 	
		</p>
		<p>
			By the word “artifact” here, I am referring to the crucial-to-understand 
			concept that what we see through the use of an imaging or interpretative 
			technique might not reflect the morphology or composition of or activity 
			of that structure when it is found in a living, intact organism.  
			This is especially the case with the invention and use of the electron 
			microscope.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although an in-depth analysis of the components of a human cell is not the 
			subject that i want to delve into, it is important to point out that scientists 
			always take electron micrograph images after the tissue is extracted from 
			its living system.  
			The tissue is then either frozen at extremely low temperatures, or soaked 
			in enzyme baths, stained with heavy metals and toxic dyes and bombarded 
			with electron beams that immediately evaporate all water contained in the 
			sample; only then is the tissue examined in a vacuum chamber on the slide.
		</p>
		<p>
			To claim that none of these highly aggressive procedures alters the 
			appearance and function of the tissue is beyond ridiculous.  
			As Hillman often pointed out, while there is some information to be gained 
			from studying electron micrograph images, all such images are artifacts in 
			that none of them accurately depict the structure in real life. 
			Remember, the only way a virus has ever been visualized is through exactly 
			these steps.  
			In fact, it is accurate to say that no one has ever seen a virus; we have seen 
			only heavy-metal stain deposits on some underlying tissue.  
		</p>
		<p>
			Newer cryotechniques try to avoid this problem, but, again, all we are 
			seeing is the frozen version of a particle with no reference to what it might 
			have actually looked like in the intact organism. Without going into great 
			depth on this fascinating subject of what really exists inside a living tissue, 
			we can equate this line of inquiry to the troublesome issues surrounding 
			virology. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Again, to do true science, we must be absolutely sure of our assumptions 
			and, in particular, we must be absolutely sure that our method of 
			investigation has not altered what we are examining.  
			It should be obvious that careful controls must be done at each step to rule 
			out that possibility. Yet, even though “radical” (as they call them) scientists 
			like Hillman have pointed out the necessity of these controls many times 
			through the years, such steps are largely ignored in science today. 
			Even something as simple as anesthetizing an animal might change that 
			animal’s biochemistry and the composition of its tissues. Shouldn’t we be 
			asking, 
		</p>
		<p>
			“What happens when we blend, freeze, dehydrate and stain with heavy 
			metals the human tissues, cells and biochemical pathways being examined 
			in a laboratory?”
		</p>
		<p>
			It turns out that this line of inquiry leads to a completely different view of 
			biology, one that is not only more accurate, but also vastly more fruitful in 
			preventing and treating sickness.  
			Let's see this issue in some detail. The first image is the usual textbook 
			drawing of the components of a cell.  
			The little circular structure called the “ribosome” is crucial to modern 
			genetic theory.  
			It is believed to be the place inside the cell where messenger RNA (mRNA) 
			is translated into protein. 
			If the ribosomes turn out to be an artifact, the entire theory of genetics 
			begins to crumble. 
		</p>
		
	-----------------IMAGE INSERT-----------------------------------------------	
		
		
		
		<p>
			Since the early discovery of ribosomes, they have been seen only using the 
			high magnification of the electron microscope.  
			They are always seen as perfect circles, either attached to the snake-like 
			structure called the “endoplasmic reticulum” or floating free in the 
			cytoplasm (the watery part of the cell outside the nucleus).  
			However, we must realize that any structure that is always perfectly circular 
			in a two-dimensional image must have been spherical in three-dimensional 
			“life.”  
		</p>
		<p>
			To find a ribosome, the homogenization of the cell is required, meaning 
			that it’s put into a kind of blender.  
			When any structure that is perfectly spherical is put into a blender, it’s 
			impossible that it would be cut into perfect circles. 
			This actually defies the basic laws of spherical geometry.  In other words, 
			the perfect circles seen on electron micrograph images for decades-drawn 
			in all modern images of the cell-must be artifacts.  
		</p>
		<p>
			That ribosomes can’t possibly exist inside an intact cell is the conclusion 
			reached by Hillman, who discussed the history of ribosomes in many of his 
			books and showed, step by step, that no one has ever proven that such a 
			structure actually even exists inside the cell. The circles are likely stained 
			gas bubbles that are the inevitable result of how the tissue is prepared. 
			If you look at another structure seen in all drawings of the components of 
			a human cell.  
		</p>
		<p>
			The endoplasmic reticulum is the long tube-like structure that, in these 
			drawings, is attached to the lining of the nucleus and to the cell wall.  
			Like ribosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum is seen only using an electron 
			micrograph, and, again like ribosomes, it is a structure crucial to the 
			modern understanding of how a cell functions.  
		</p>
		<p>
			I think that it was “invented” to solve the problem biologists faced when 
			they theorized that the DNA is contained in the nucleus, which is bound 
			by a membrane. 
			We have been taught that pH is an indicator of hydrogen ion concentration.  
			Direct measurement in intact cells has shown that the pH within the 
			cytoplasm is different from the pH inside the nucleus.  
		</p>
		<p>
			This phenomenon can only mean that hydrogen (H+) ions are not able to 
			freely pass from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and that the membrane of 
			the nucleus must be a barrier preventing the free diffusion of H+ and other 
			small ions from nucleus to cytoplasm. 
		</p>
		<p>
			This observation only raises an obvious question:  
		</p>
		<p>
			“How does the mRNA, which is thousands of times larger than an H+ ion, 
			pass from the nucleus where it is made to the cytoplasm, where it can be 
			translated into protein, without letting the much smaller H+ ion also pass 
			from nucleus to cytoplasm, resulting in an equilibration (balancing) of the 
			pH between nucleus and cytoplasm?”
		</p>
		<p>
			When cell biologists saw snake-like lines seemingly attached to the nuclear 
			membrane, they thought they had their answer.  
			That answer goes something like this: The mRNA is transcribed from the 
			DNA in the nucleus; it then goes out of the nucleus through the tube-like 
			endoplasmic reticulum, where it meets the ribosomes attached to the 
			endoplasmic reticulum, where it can be translated into protein.
		</p>
		<p>
			Never mind that at some point, there must be an exit, and that exit would 
			have to be thousands of times larger than the H+ ion (which would allow 
			the H+ ion to freely diffuse into and out of the hole or exit in the 
			endoplasmic reticulum).  
			The cell biologists got around this dilemma by postulating that there must 
			be some sort of one-way door (that would be found some day). 
			There is a second problem with this theory, besides the whole exit issue 
			that i talked about.
		</p>
		<p>
			When one looks at live cells under a light microscope or under a laser 
			microscope, it is easy to see that the nucleus is continually rotating, even 
			sometimes doing 360-degree rotations.  
			If there were structures connecting the nucleus by a cord to the outer cell 
			wall, such nuclear rotation would be impossible. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Again, the laws of simple mechanics suggest that the endoplasmic 
			reticulum, a structure never seen except through electron microscope 
			images, is another artifact that simply doesn’t exist in an intact, living cell 
			inside the living body. 
			Instead, I think that it is likely a precipitation (or an artifact) created by the 
			destructive techniques used to create electron micrograph images.
		</p>
		
	---------------------IMAGE INSERT----------------------------------------
		
		
		<p>
			When you compare the previous drawing-depicting what cell biologists 
			theorize to be the components of the cell-with an actual photograph of a 
			“live” cell (albeit still removed from its home organism and studied 
			separately from it), we see a much different picture.  
		</p>
		<p>
			In fact, the only structures visible in the live cell photograph are a thin 
			membrane around the cell, a watery cytoplasm, small dark lines (which are 
			known to be mitochondria) and a nucleus.  
			And that is it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Interestingly, after reading thousands of pages of Hillman and Ling, this 
			observation fits exactly with the conclusions of both of these men. 
			As I said earlier, the cells of our bodies are organized either as homogenous 
			tissues (syncytia) or as compartments called cells.  
		</p>
		<p>
			Cells are bounded by a single-layer membrane that is likely fat-soluble and 
			is the site where the water in the cell is the thickest or most organized.  
			The cytoplasm consists of organized, structured (or coherent) water. The 
			water becomes more coherent and consistent as it moves to the periphery, 
			less coherent as it moves toward the nucleus in the center. 
			Finally, there is a nucleus, also bound by a thin, likely fat-soluble, single
			layer membrane. 
		</p>
		<p>
			As this second image shows, there are no other organelles (components) 
			inside the cell; moreover, there are no pumps or receptors in the 
			membranes and there are no cristae (i mean sub-compartments) in the 
			mitochondria. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The basic structure of life-consistent with the teachings of all ancient 
			wisdom streams, all traditional forms of science and medicine as well as 
			careful modern scientific observation- is coherent, organized water with 
			stuff like amino acids, minerals, proteins and genetic material embedded 
			in the cellular water. 
			What is the organizational principle creating this infinitely flexible 
			coherent-water crystal?
		</p>
		<p>
			Mostly, it is the energy of the sun, light and all the various frequencies, 
			energy forms, wavelengths, sounds, colors, thoughts, emotions and other 
			emanations that come to us from the world.  
			In other words, the organizational principle comes from outside the cell, 
			even outside the organism.
		</p>
		<p>
			This simple, powerful picture is the key to understanding health and 
			disease. It is also the key to reimagining a world that serves rather than 
			destroys life. It is the key to reconnecting with our spiritual origins and 
			disconnecting from the current push to embed the entire world in 
			destructive energetic patterns and forms.
		</p>
		<p>
			In short, understanding this is the way out of this current catastrophe.
		</p>
